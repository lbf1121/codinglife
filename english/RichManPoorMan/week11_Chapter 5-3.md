### Chapter 5-3
    I said nothing.
    Mr Sheth gave me the money order back.
    Then Mr Sheth smiled and said, "I am very sorry. You are an old man. 
    You came a long way from your village. What can I give you to eat and drink?"
    I was not hungry.
    But Mr Sheth went out of the room. Then he brought me some coffee and some cakes. I drank my coffee.
    "Old man," said Mr Sheth, "I like to help people. I am a rich man. Give me your money order."
    I gave my money order to Mr Sheth.
    "Yes, this money order is worthless," he said again. "But I am going to help you. I am going to change this money order for you. I am going to give you some money." Mr Sheth went out of the room.
    I felt very happy again.
    After a few minutes, the tall man came into the room.
    He gave me an envelope. "This is from Mr Sheth. You can go now," the tall man said.
    I went out of the house. I walked along the road to the bus station.
    I opened the envelope and I took out my money. I counted the money. It was ten pounds.
    I thought about my only son, Saul. My son, Saul, had sent me a money order for one hundred pounds.
    Mr Sheth had given me ten pounds.
    I felt old and I felt poor again.
