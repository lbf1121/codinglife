### Adam Changes his Money Order Chapter 5-1
    Next day I told my story to all the villagers.
    The villagers were angry.
    Martha was very unhappy. She said,"Saul is working very hard.He is sending money and we can't have the money. What are we going to do?"
    I did not know.
    Then in the evening the school teacher came to my house again.
    "Adam. Perhaps I can help you," the school teacher said.
    "Here is a letter to Mr Sheth".
    "Mr Sheth?" I said, "Who is he?"
    "He's an important man in Darpur and he's a friend of my wife's cousin," replied the school teacher.
    "This letter is to Mr Sheth. The letter is about your money order. Perhaps he can help you."
    I took the letter and thanked the school teacher.
    So I travelled to Darpur again on Saturday,for the three time.
    After a long time,I found the Mr Sheth's house.
    The door was opened by a tall man."Can I see Mr Sheth?" I asked.
    "And who are you?" the tall man asked.
    "I have a letter for Mr Sheth," I replied.
    "I see. Can I have the letter,please?" And the tall man held out his hand.
    "The letter is here." I said. And I took the letter out of my pocket. "But I must see Mr Sheth."
    "Many people want to see the Mr Sheth," the tall man told me.
    "He is a very busy man and a very  important man. Mr Sheth is not here at the moment. But give me your letter, and Mr Sheth will read it later."
    I gave the tall man the letter. Then I waited.
    Later, a large black car came and a man went into the house.
    A long time later,the tall man opened the door again.
    "Come in now,please, and follow me," he said.
    I followed the tall man. We went into a large room with fine carpets and big chairs.
