"I am Adam of Minta village," I replied.
"Yes,I know," said Mr Sheth. "Thank you for the letter. I hope I can help you. I like to help people. Please sit down." Mr Sheth smiled. His clothes were new and smart.
"Thank you," I said.
"Can I see the money order,please?" the Mr Sheth asked.
I took the money order out of my pocket.
By now, the money order was dirty and looked very old.
I gave it to Mr Sheth. "This money order is for one hundred pounds," I said. "My son sent it from a foreign country."
Mr Sheth unfolded the money order and looked at it.
"You can't change this money order," he said. "This money order is not worth one hundred pounds. This money order is worth nothing."
"Worth nothing!Worthless?" I asked.
