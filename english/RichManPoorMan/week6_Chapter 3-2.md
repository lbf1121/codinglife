    And he gave me a mirror and a comb.
    "I don't want a mirror,I don't want a comb. Please take my photograph. 
    I'm going to Minta this afternoon. And I'm in a hurry," I said.
    "Yes," he said. "But first the price. This is the best camera in Darpur and I'm the best photographer. 
    These photographs will cost you two pounds fifty."
    "Two pounds fifty!" And I laughed.
    "Two pounds fifty-and pay me now please," the photographer answered.
    I did not know the price of photographs. What could I do?
    Then the photographer said, "You are an old man. For you, the price is two pounds."
    So I gave him the money and he took the photographs.
    "Come back tomorrow morning," he said.
    "I want my three photographs now, immediately," I said.
    "Don't be stupid," the photographer said. "Photographs take twenty-four hours. Come back tomorrow."
    What could I do? So I said, "Yes. Tomorrow morning."
    "Good," said the photographer. "Now go. I have a lot of work. I'm very busy."
    I went back to the bus station. I sat on the bus for three hours.
    I walked ten miles back to my village.
    It was night time and I was very tired.
    Martha and my friends were waiting for me.
    "Where is the money?" Martha asked.
    "I have no money. I cannot change the money order. First I must have an Identity Card." 
    And I told Martha everything.
    "Tomorrow I am going to Darpur again," I said.
    Then I did not talk again.
    I was very tired and it was late at night.
    I lay on my bed and I slept.
