### Chapter 4-2
    After a long time the photographer came back.
    He looked tired and he smelt of beer.
    "Give me my photographs," I said. "I have waited a long time for you."
    The photographer looked at me and said, "I don't know you, old man. What photographs are you talking about?"
    "My three photographs for my Identity Card. I paid you two pounds for them on Tuesday. Give me my photographs immediately or my money."
    "Your photographs? Your money? What are you talking about?" the photographer said."Show me the paper. Show my the receipt for your money."
    "My receipt?" I asked.
    "Yes. Where is your receipt?" the photographer asked.
    "You did not give me a receipt," I shouted. "Give me my photographs or my money immediately." And I hit the photographer hard with my stick.
    I am old, but I am still strong.
    The photographer fell on the ground. He shouted, "Help! Help! This old man is killing me."
    And I hit hard again.
    Lots of people ran out of their houses.
    I hit the photographer again and two men held me.
    I could not get away from the two men.
    The photographer was very angry and I was very angry.
    Lots of people were shouting.
    Then a policeman came.
    The photographer shouted to the policeman, "This old man hit me three times with his stick. He's stick. He's a thief and a murderer. He wants my money."
    The policeman held my arm and said, "Come with me to the police station."
    I did not say anything. We walked to the police station.
    At the police station, the policeman asked me, "Did you hit that man three times?"
    "Yes, " I said, "he did not give me my photographs."
    "Show me your Identity Card," said the policeman.
    "I am Adam of Minta village," I replied, "and I haven't got an Identity Card."
    "Old man," said the policeman. "Go back to your village. Don't come here and fight. Keep out of Darpur."
    And he pushed me into the street.
    I went back to my village.
    I was tired and angry.
