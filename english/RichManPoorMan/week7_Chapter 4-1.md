## Week Seven
### Chapter 4-1 No Photographs
    I work up late the next morning.
    The sun was already high.
    I did not walk to the main road and catch a bus.
    All the buses go to Darpur early in the morning.
    So I stayed at home on Wednesday.
    I was still tired.
    I rested and talked to the villagers about the money order.
    I told them about the Identity Card and the photographer.
    The school teacher said, "Yes,the official is correct. In a Post Office,you always show your Identity Card."
    The school teacher filled in my application form for an Identity Card.
    Application Form For Identity Card
    Name:Adam Jamei
    Address: Village of Minta
    Age: 72 years
    Place of birth: Village of Minta
    Occupation: Farmer
    Color of eyes: Brown
    On Thursday I travelled to Darpur again.
    I walked to the main road and I caught a bus.
    In Darpur, I walked to the house of the photographer.
    I knocked on the door of the house.
    No one came to the door.
    I knocked again loudly with my stick.
    A woman opened the door.
    "Who are you? What do you want?" she asked.
    "Can I have my photographs, please?" I said.
    "Your photographs? I have no photographs," the woman replied.
    "I came here on Tuesday. Where is the photographer?" I asked.
    "He's out. He's not here." And the woman closed the door.
    I shouted at her, "I'm waiting here for him."
