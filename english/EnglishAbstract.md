### Rich Man Poor Man
### Chapter 1-1  A Letter for Adam
    One day a postman came to my village.
    The postman brought me a letter from my son, Saul.
    "Is your name Adam?" the postman asked.
    "Yes," I said.
    "I've got a letter for you."
    The postman read the envelope: "Adam of the village of Minta."
    "A letter for me. Who is it from?" I asked.
    The postman looked at the envelope again. "From Saul" he said.
    He gave me the letter and walked away.
    "Martha, Martha," I called to my wife.
    "Come here. We have a letter from our son, Saul."
    Martha came out and looked at the letter.
    She was excited but she was also worried.
    "A letter from Saul," she said. "Is he alive and well? I'm going to find the school teacher. He can read the letter."
    There was no school fifty years ago.
    So I cannot read or write.
    I live in a small village.
    The only work is farming.
    My only son, Saul, left the village two years ago and my three daughters are married.
    Saul is making a lot of money in a foreign country.

### Chapter 2-2 
    Finally it was my turn,I was at the front of the queue.
    But the official did not serve me.
    "Excuse me," I said."It's my turn.I'm next."
    "You are next? Old man,I'm very busy," the official said.
    "Look at my papers.Look at all these people. I am very busy.And you must wait." 
    So I waited.
    Finaly the official looked at me. "What do you want?" he asked.
    I gave him my money order.
    "This is my money order for one hundred pounds," I replied.
    The official held out his hand. "Identity Card," he said.
    "Excuse me. I don't understand," I replied.
    "Your Identity Card," the official said again."Give me your Identity Card."
    "What is an Identity Card?" I asked.
    "I can't give you any money for this money order.First I must see your Identity Card.
    Your Identity Card gives your name and your address.Your Identity Card describes you.
    There is a photograph of you in your Identity Card.I don't know you.Who are you?"The
    official was a little angry.
    But I was also angry."Who am I?" I said."Everyone knows me.I am Adam of the village of Minta.
    I haven't got an Identity Card and I don't neet an Identity Card."
    "Old man,I'm very busy and you're very stupid," the official said."Who are you? Where is Minta?"
    "Give me my money.Give me my one hundred pounds," I said.
    The official looked angry and said,"Show me your Identity Card.I don't know you."
    The official gave back my money order and he turned away.
    "Where can I buy an Identity Card?" I asked the official.

    "Fill in this application form,"the official said.
    "And bring the form and three photographs of yourself and two pounds.Come back tomorrow."

    I live in Minta.I live five hours' journey from Darpur.I'm an old man."
    "Yes,come back tomorrow."And the official turned away.
    I walked away from the Ministry of the Interior.
    I walked to the market.
    At the market I looked at everyone.
    I was looking for a man from my village.
    But I could not find a villager.
    So then I walked to the shop of Rick.

    "I see.You need some photographs."
    And he showed me the way to a photographer.

    The man's clothes were dirty and he looked tired.
    "I need an Identity Card," I said."I want three photographs of myself."
    "Yes,you want three photographs of yourself," the photographer replied.
    "And I take very good photographs.Come and see my camera."
    We walked into his room. In the middle of the room was a large camera.
    "This is the best camera in Darpur. This camera is very good," the photographer said proudly.
    "I've never seen a camera," I said."I don't know about cameras."
    "Hurry up and take a photograph of me."
    "Please do not hurry me,old man," the photographer said."I am an artist."
