<h2>Chapter 1-1</h2><br>
    A Letter for Adam<br>
    One day a postman came to my village.<br>
    The postman brought me a letter from my son, Saul.<br>
    "Is your name Adam?" the postman asked.<br>
    "Yes," I said.<br>
    "I've got a letter for you."<br>
    The postman read the envelope: "Adam of the village of Minta."<br>
    "A letter for me. Who is it from?" I asked.<br>
    The postman looked at the envelope again. "From Saul" he said.<br>
    He gave me the letter and walked away.<br>
    "Martha, Martha," I called to my wife.<br>
    "Come here. We have a letter from our son, Saul."<br>
    Martha came out and looked at the letter.<br>
    She was excited but she was also worried.<br>
    "A letter from Saul," she said. "Is he alive and well? I'm going to find the school teacher. He can read the letter."<br>
    There was no school fifty years ago.<br>
    So I cannot read or write.<br>
    I live in a small village.<br>
    The only work is farming.<br>
    My only son, Saul, left the village two years ago and my three daughters are married.<br>
    Saul is making a lot of money in a foreign country.<br>
