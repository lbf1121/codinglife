### Rich Man Poor Man
### Chapter 1-1  A Letter for Adam
    One day a postman came to my village.
    The postman brought me a letter from my son, Saul.
    "Is your name Adam?" the postman asked.
    "Yes," I said.
    "I've got a letter for you."<br>
    The postman read the envelope: "Adam of the village of Minta."<br>
    "A letter for me. Who is it from?" I asked.<br>
    The postman looked at the envelope again. "From Saul" he said.<br>
    He gave me the letter and walked away.<br>
    "Martha, Martha," I called to my wife.<br>
    "Come here. We have a letter from our son, Saul."<br>
    Martha came out and looked at the letter.<br>
    She was excited but she was also worried.<br>
    "A letter from Saul," she said. "Is he alive and well? I'm going to find the school teacher. He can read the letter."<br>
    There was no school fifty years ago.<br>
    So I cannot read or write.<br>
    I live in a small village.<br>
    The only work is farming.<br>
    My only son, Saul, left the village two years ago and my three daughters are married.<br>
    Saul is making a lot of money in a foreign country.<br>

    "You are next?Old man,I'm very busy," the official said.
    "Look at all these people. I am very busy.And you must wait." 
    So I waited.
    Finaly the official looked at me. "What do you want?" he asked.
    I gave hime my money order.
    "This is my money order for one hundred pounds," I replied.
    The official held out his hand. "Identity Card," he said.
    "Excuse me. I don't understand," I repliedk.
    "Your Identity Card," the official said again."Give me your Identity Card."
    "What is an Identity Card?" I asked.
