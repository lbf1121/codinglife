### Rich Man Poor Man
### Chapter 1-1  A Letter for Adam
    One day a postman came to my village.
    The postman brought me a letter from my son, Saul.
    "Is your name Adam?" the postman asked.
    "Yes," I said.
    "I've got a letter for you."
    The postman read the envelope: "Adam of the village of Minta."
    "A letter for me. Who is it from?" I asked.
    The postman looked at the envelope again. "From Saul" he said.
    He gave me the letter and walked away.
    "Martha, Martha," I called to my wife.
    "Come here. We have a letter from our son, Saul."
    Martha came out and looked at the letter.
    She was excited but she was also worried.
    "A letter from Saul," she said. "Is he alive and well? I'm going to find the school teacher. He can read the letter."
    There was no school fifty years ago.
    So I cannot read or write.
    I live in a small village.
    The only work is farming.
    My only son, Saul, left the village two years ago and my three daughters are married.
    Saul is making a lot of money in a foreign country.

    "You are next? Old man,I'm very busy," the official said.
    "Look at my papers.Look at all these people. I am very busy.And you must wait." 
    So I waited.
    Finaly the official looked at me. "What do you want?" he asked.
    I gave him my money order.
    "This is my money order for one hundred pounds," I replied.
    The official held out his hand. "Identity Card," he said.
    "Excuse me. I don't understand," I replied.
    "Your Identity Card," the official said again."Give me your Identity Card."

    But I was also angry."Who am I?" I said."Everyone knows me.I am Adam of the village of Minta.
    I haven't got an Identity Card and I don't neet an Identity Card."
    "Old man,I'm very busy and you're very stupid," the official said."Who are you? Where is Minta?"

## Week Eight
### Chapter 4-2
    After a long time the photographer came back.
    He looked tired and he smelt of beer.
    "Give me my photographs," I said. "I have waited a long time for you."
    The photographer looked at me and said, "I don't know you, old man. What photographs are you talking about?"
    "My three photographs for my Identity Card. I paid you two pounds for them on Tuesday. Give me my photographs immediately or my money."
    "Your photographs? Your money? What are you talking about?" the photographer said."Show me the paper.Show my the receipt for your money."
    "My receipt?" I asked.
    "Yes. Where is your receipt?"k the photographer asked.
    "You did not give me a receipt," I shouted. "Give me my photographs or my money immediately." And I hit the photographer hard with my stick.
    I am old, but I am still strong.
    The photographer fell on the ground. He shouted, "Help! Help! This old man is killing me."
    And I hit hard again.
    Lots of people ran out of their houses.
    I hit the photographer again and two men held me.
    I could not get away from the two men.
    The photographer was very angry and I was very angry.
    Lots of people were shouting.
    Then a policeman came.
    The photographer shouted to the policeman, "This old man hit me three times with his stick. He's stick. He's a thief and a murderer. He wants my money."
    The policeman held my arm and said, "Come with me to the police station."
    I did not say anything. We walked to the police station.
    At the police station, the policeman asked me, "Did you hit that man three times?"
    "Yes, " I said, "he did not give me my photographs."
    "Show me your Identity Card," said the policeman.
    "I am Adam of Minta village," I replied, "and I haven't got an Identity Card."
    "Old man," said the policeman. "Go back to your village. Don't come here and fight. Keep out of Darpur."
    And he pushed me into the street.
    I went back to my village.
    I was tired and angry.
