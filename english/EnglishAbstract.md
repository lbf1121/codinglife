>>>>A Letter for Adam
>>One day a postman came to my village.
The postman brought me a letter from my son, Saul.
"Is your name Adam?" the postman asked.
"Yes," I said.
"I've got a letter for you."
The postman read the envelope: "Adam of the village of Minta."
"A letter for me. Who is it from?" I asked.
The postman looked at the envelope again. "From Saul" he said.
He gave me the letter and walked away.
"Martha, Martha," I called to my wife.
"Come here. We have a letter from our son, Saul."
Martha came out and looked at the letter.
She was excited but she was also worried.
"A letter from Saul," she said. "Is he alive and well? I'm going to find the school teacher. He can read the letter."
There was no school fifty years ago.
So I cannot read or write.
I live in a small village.
The only work is farming.
My only son, Saul, left the village two years ago and my three daughters are married.
Saul is making a lot of money in a foreign country.
